# Frontend Uniswap Clone
This is a project to test my front-end JS/React skills.  
My goal is to use this project too keep track of my progress.  
I plan on updating this project in the future with new tools I learned. Right now im planning on etherjs integration and in the future a self-build solidity smart-contract.  
  
Have fun going through my wonderfull code and commit history ;)!
